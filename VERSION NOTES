BME.1.3 - Importing Excel floorplan successful 
BME.1.4 - agents move to signs, obstacles still transparent
BME.1.5.1 - 38 % percentage activated agents
BME.1.5.2 - non-activated agents are activated by active agents within vision 
BME.1.5.3 - n % intoxicated agents are introduced and vision is halved for intoxicated agents 
BME.1.5.4 - intoxicated agents need three activated agents within vision before they get activated, while non-intoxicated only need one
BME.1.6 - signs with direction?

Now I would like to change the signs into signs with direction. When the agent steps on a sign it will therefore go walk into the direction the sign is pointing to, until it either finds another exit or sign. The priorities of action are now: nearest exit; nearest sign; walk in the direction the sign was pointing to; walk randomly. Hence, when it cannot walk any further and does not find any exit or a new sign it starts to move randomly again.
