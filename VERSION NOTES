BME.1.3 - Importing Excel floorplan successful 
BME.1.4 - agents move to signs, obstacles still transparent
BME.1.5.1 - 38 % percentage activated agents
BME.1.5.2 - non-activated agents are activated by active agents within vision 
BME.1.5.3 - n % intoxicated agents are introduced and vision is halved for intoxicated agents 
BME.1.5.4 - intoxicated agents need three activated agents within vision before they get activated, while non-intoxicated only need one
BME.1.6 - The agent remembers signs and only goes to the signs they haven't touched yet. [Hopefully, this leads to a path to the exit for floorplan_C. However, vision is in general too low to make it work yet, especially for intoxicated agents.]
BME.1.7â€”Agents cannot look through high obstacles. Also, low obstacles are added, and the Excel map clarity is increased. 
BME.1.7.1 - Sensitivity analysis is added.
BME 1.8 First try of batch running graph plotting exit times
BME.1.7.3 - second try of adding a batch runner
BME.1.7.4 - adding extra metrics to data collection such as density
